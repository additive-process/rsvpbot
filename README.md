# rsvpbot
Discord bot that sends RSVP-ers' info to the event organizer.

(Step 0: Heed the replace comments, get your Discord bot key and deploy it! If this is your first time deploying a Discord bot, don't panic - it's easy! I used this guide to get started while knowing very little about Python https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-python/)

Step 1:
Create a new private channel.

Step 2:
Invite the RSVPbot to your server.

Step 3:
Give the RSVPbot a unique permission such that only you and RSVPbot can view and post in the new channel.

Step 4:
Use /rsvp in the channel you'd like to launch RSVPbot in and let your RSVP-ers and RSVPbot take care of the rest!
